## Why you need NOTEST?
If you're developing a web application, you need to test it.

But, **you don't want to write tests manually**.

There are lots of tools to write tests automatically.

NOTEST has a different approach.

Our idea is simple: someone will use your webapp. 
**When it happens, NOTEST creates a test and saves it for the future.**

Without coding, you can be sure that your web app keeps working as expected, 
at a fraction of the time and keep those tests forever.

## How to get started using NOTEST?
NOTEST is very simple:
1) download the NOTEST chrome extension;
2) open your webapp;
3) click on the NOTEST icon to the right of the page;
4) click on the "Start" button;

NOTEST will start recording your actions and will create a test for you.

You can then find a video of the recorded session.

NOTEST will automatically execute the test again and again, to verify that your webapp keeps working as expected.
