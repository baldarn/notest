        QBerg was not writing tests at all. Now they have a complete test coverage made for free by a NOTEST.
        
        People at QBerg have a staging environment and they test the web application there before release. 
        Now when they try new features, NOTEST generates tests and run them at each release.

                NOTEST checks your webapp continuously and <b>alerts you if something breaks</b>. 
                Use cases such as login, registration, and your web app main features are <b>checked at each release</b> so things will not break anymore.

                NOTEST <b>generates e2e/user tests, unit tests, integration tests, and visual component tests</b> while your team develops new features.
